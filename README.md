# my-first-text-classifier
In this project, I used the sklearn library to practically explore the workings of some classifiers. I managed to create several semantic classifiers using:

- Linear Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- SVC

I utilized a dataset of comments from Twitter, available at the following link: [Twitter dataset](https://query.data.world/s/ucw6adw4twegolswpwcjwipvlke2y6?dws=00000)
